# MonoGame.Templates
MonoGame repo to hold our project templates

# NOTE:
When creating your projects from these templates, using commands like `dotnet new mg2dstartkit -n {SomeName}` Do NOT use numbers as the 1st character of the name of your project. These will be replaced by underscores, `_`, and will break the templates.
